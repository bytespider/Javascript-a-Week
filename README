#Javascript a Week#
Javascript a Week is a project to improve my javasript knowledge, and provide a
useful set of javascript for novices of the language.

Feel free to fork the scripts, improve them and comment on how else something
could be done. Help others to learn by example.

If you have any ideas of things I could code each week then drop me an email.
